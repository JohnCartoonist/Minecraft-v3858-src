# Minecraft-v3858-src
Minecraft v3858 is a mod for Minecraft Alpha v1.0.0 that not only restores Minecraft Infdev 20100415's terrain generator, but it also aims to expand upon it while retaining its core "feel". I also restored the vertical background scroll Minecraft Indev 20100202-2330 had for the title screen, so there's that too.

Besides the title screen thing, what you're getting is a fusion of Minecraft Infdev 20100415's and Minecraft Alpha v1.0.0's world generation. I hope you enjoy my mod :)
